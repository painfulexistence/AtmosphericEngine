## Devlog

- 2024/03/22 - considering using glad+sdl2 instead of glew+glfw
- 2024/06/24 - upgraded dear imgui so that it can work on Apple M3 machines
- 2024/06/26 - fixed an issue where the error is not thrown when the framebuffer is incomplete (missing "throw" keyword)
- 2024/06/26 - fixed an issue where glGetString(GL_VERSION) returns null and all textures are missing and not loadable by switching to system-wide GLEW and back
- 2024/06/26 - found out that passing vec3(0, 0, 0) to shadow pass World matrix can cause an interesting bug where the shadows move autonomously
- 2024/06/27 - implemented normal mapping (normals flipped)
- 2024/06/28 - fixed flipped normals
- 2024/06/28 - it turns out that the bottleneck is light calculation; turning aux lights off can make the game run at a reasonable speed
- 2024/06/29 - using high frequency image (such as brown_mud_leaves_norm_gl.jpg) as a height map can generate an interesting effect
- 2024/06/30 - implemented a tessellated terrain
- 2024/07/03 - implemented phyiscs debug UI and learned that constantly growing std::vector without reserving space can cause freeze
- 2025/01/09 - unable to resolve "fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'm.lib'" on Windows
- 2025/05/25 - realized that LNK1104 might be caused by raudio or lua, solved by removing raudio
- TODO: use std::filesystem to get the correct asset loading path
